      "I would recommend Gary and his company without any reservation after the fantastic job he did for us. From the first contact he gives confidence with his most pleasant yet professional manner. He was very busy, told me how long the wait might be and then did everything he could to do the work sooner,getting it done before Christmas. They worked unobtrusively, cleanly and carefully. The results are excellent. His quote was better than others, but notwithstanding that, I would definitely ask him to do another job for us if necessary,before others. Thanks and well done.\n",
      "From quote to completion of work I could not fault this company. Very prompt to quote, competitive price and communication excellent at all stages of the process. Job completed to a very high standard and tidied up after completion ( even checking debris in neighbours garden). I would have no hesitation in recommending.\n",
      "Had my roof completely done on my new extension, and decided to have more work done on the existing roof. Rang Gary and he came out of his way super quick to have a look and came up with a solution and completed the work immediately. Super fast very trustworthy and brilliant job done on the spot. Would highly recomend Sutton Roofing if you want a honest job done and right first time every time.????????\n",
      "Highly recommend Sutton Roofing. Garry and Steve are very professional and friendly. Attention to detail. Hard working to get the job accomplished tirelessly despite under the hot weather, tidied up not a single debris. Excellent value for money and quality. 100% positive experience. They are so good that I will definitely recommend to others.\n",
