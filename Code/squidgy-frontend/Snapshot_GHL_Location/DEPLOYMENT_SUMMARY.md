## 🚀 API Endpoints (Ready for Production)

### Solar Clone API
```
BASE_URL: https://your-domain.com/api/ghl

POST   /solar-clone              - Create new Solar clone
GET    /solar-clone/{clone_id}   - Check clone status  
GET    /solar-clones             - List all clones
DELETE /solar-clone/{clone_id}   - Cancel clone operation
GET    /solar-clone-health       - Service health check
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Create Solar sub-account for new Squidgy user
response = await create_solar_clone({
    "source_location_id": "JUTFTny8EXQOSB5NcvAA",
    "target_location_name": f"{user.company}_SOL_Clone_SB", 
    "target_company_id": user.ghl_company_id,
    "add_dummy_data": True,
    "notification_email": user.email
})

# Result: Complete Solar CRM ready in 2-3 minutes
```

## 🔧 Integration for Squidgy

### When Users Register
```python
# Background process during Squidgy registration
async def setup_user_solar_crm(user):
    # 1. Create Solar sub-account automatically
    clone_result = await solar_clone_service.create_clone({
        "target_location_name": f"{user.company}_SOL_Clone_SB",
        "target_company_id": user.ghl_company_id,
        "notification_email": user.email
    })
    
    # 2. User gets complete Solar CRM ready to use
    # No manual snapshot upload needed!
    
    return clone_result.target_location_id
```

### Result
- ✅ **Instant Solar CRM** for every new user
